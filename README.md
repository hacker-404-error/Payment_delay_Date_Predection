# Payment-Date-Prediction
<li>Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it gets created in the system. </li>
<li> Categorize the invoice into different buckets based on predicted payment date. </li>
<br>
The invoices dataset contains the past payment information and behaviour of various buyers. Based on the previous payment patterns, the ML model will predict what 
will be the date a payment is made by the customer for an invoice.<br>
The model will also predict which aging bucket the invoice falls into based on the predicted payment date.<br>
The different buckets will be :

<li> 0-15 days </li>
<li> 16-30 days </li>
<li> 31-45 days </li>
<li> 46-60 days </li>
<li> Greater than 60 days </li>
